# Micro SaaS: Restaurant Menu Creation and Management

## 1. Overview
This Micro SaaS provides restaurants with a **dynamic, QR-code-based menu system** that integrates with Square POS for real-time menu synchronization. The system allows **waiters to manage tables and receive service requests**, while managers can oversee menu updates and staff assignments.

## 2. Core Features
### MVP Features:
1. **Dynamic Digital Menu**
   - Accessible via QR code.
   - Displays a categorized menu with item details (descriptions, ingredients, allergens, images).
   - Supports **English and Spanish** with automated translations.

2. **Real-Time Menu Customization**
   - **Automatic sync with Square POS** to maintain a single source of truth.
   - Manual edits possible within the Micro SaaS, but Square changes override them.

3. **Interactive Ordering & Table Management**
   - **Waiters have logins** to manage assigned tables.
   - Customers can flag waiters for assistance (notifications sent to assigned waiter’s tablet/wearable device).
   - Manual table assignments by waiters.

4. **Personalized Recommendations & Upsells**
   - Recommended dishes based on **chef’s picks or customer favorites**.
   - Upselling suggestions (e.g., “Would you like fries with that?”).

5. **Integration with POS Systems & Payments**
   - **Square POS integration** for real-time menu sync.
   - Future support for more POS systems (Toast, Clover, Lightspeed).
   
## 3. System Architecture
### **Frontend:**
- **React (Next.js)** for performance and SEO benefits.
- TailwindCSS for styling.
- i18n support for dynamic language switching.

### **Backend:**
- **Node.js + Express** for handling requests.
- MongoDB for menu storage (in case of POS sync delays).
- WebSockets for real-time waiter notifications.

### **Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- **JWT-based authentication**
- **Roles:**
  - **Admin/Manager:** Manage users, assign tables, edit menu.
  - **Waiter:** Receive service requests, manage assigned tables.
  - **Future:** Kitchen staff for direct order reception.

## 4. Data Handling & Synchronization
### **Menu Syncing Process:**
1. **Changes in Square** → Auto-updates Micro SaaS menu.
2. **Changes in Micro SaaS** → Allowed, but overridden by next Square sync.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** Square takes priority, but users are notified.

### **Table Management:**
- Manual assignment via **dashboard**.
- Optional **per-waiter table limit** set by managers.
- Waiters can update their own assignments.

## 5. Error Handling Strategies
- **Network failures:** Show cached menu if Square sync fails.
- **POS sync failures:** Log error, retry in the background.
- **Failed waiter notifications:** Alert the user and retry.
- **QR Code errors:** Show a default fallback menu.

## 6. Testing Plan
### **Unit Testing:**
- Menu fetching, caching, and sync validation.
- Role-based access control enforcement.

### **Integration Testing:**
- Square API sync handling.
- WebSocket-based waiter notifications.

### **End-to-End Testing:**
- QR code scanning & menu display.
- Waiter login, table assignment, and service request flows.

## 7. Deployment & Scaling Considerations
- **Vercel for frontend hosting** (serverless functions for some backend logic).
- **AWS Lambda / DigitalOcean App Platform for backend API.**
- **MongoDB Atlas for cloud storage.**
- Future **multi-tenant architecture** for scaling to multiple restaurants.
